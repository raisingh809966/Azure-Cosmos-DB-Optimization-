I need a comprehensive solution for optimizing costs in our Azure serverless architecture that uses Cosmos DB for billing records. Please provide:

1. Detailed Solution Requirements:
- A step-by-step approach to implement cost optimization while maintaining:
  * Simplicity & ease of implementation (minimal changes to existing infrastructure)
  * Zero data loss and zero downtime during migration
  * No changes to existing API contracts
- Specific Azure services to use (with justification for each)
- Data partitioning/archival strategy for records older than 3 months
- Implementation timeline estimates
- Cost comparison before/after optimization

2. Bonus Components:
- Architecture diagram showing:
  * Current vs proposed architecture
  * Data flow for both new and archived records
  * Integration points with existing services
- Pseudocode/scripts for:
  * Data archival process (including error handling)
  * Retrieval logic for archived records
  * Cost monitoring automation
- Implementation checklist with:
  * Prerequisites
  * Deployment steps
  * Validation procedures
  * Rollback plan

3. Technical Specifications:
- Recommended Cosmos DB configuration changes
- Partition key strategy
- Consistency level adjustments
- Indexing policy optimizations
- Retention policy settings

4. Operational Considerations:
- Monitoring approach for the new solution
- Alerting strategy for archival/retrieval failures
- Maintenance procedures
- Performance testing recommendations

Format the solution as a complete technical document suitable for engineering implementation, with clear section headers and actionable items.
